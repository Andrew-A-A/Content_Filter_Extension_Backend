   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Andrew-A-A/Content_Filter_Extension_Backend.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd Content_Filter_Extension_Backend
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

### Installing Required Packages

This project manages its dependencies using a `requirements.txt` file. Once you've activated your virtual environment, you can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

After setting up the virtual environment and installing the necessary packages, you can run the Flask application. By default, the Flask development server will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

To start the server in debug mode, run the following command:

```
flask --app app run --debug 
```
